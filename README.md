## Installation and Usage

1. Install the CLI:

   ```sh
   npm install -g aicommits
   ```

2. Retrieve your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

   > Note: If you haven't already, you'll have to create an account and set up billing.

3. Set the key so aicommits can use it:

   ```sh
   echo "OPENAI_KEY=<your token>" >> ~/.aicommits
   ```

4. You're ready to go!

   Run `aicommits` in any Git repo and it will generate a commit message for you.

## How it works

This CLI tool runs `git diff` to grab all your latest code changes, sends them to OpenAI's GPT-3, then returns the AI generated commit message.

Video coming soon where I rebuild it from scratch to show you how to easily build your own CLI tools powered by AI.

## Future tasks

- Add support for conventional commits as a flag that users can enable
- Add support for diffs greater than 200 lines by grabbing the diff per file, optional flag
- Add ability to specify a commit message from inside aicommit if user doesn't like generated one
- Solve latency issue (use a githook to asynchronously run gpt3 call on every git add, store the result in a temp file or in the .git folder). Put behind a flag
- Use gpt-3-tokenizer instead of hard limit on characters as a more accurate model
- Play around with prompt to produce optimal result
- Add opt-in emoji flag to preface commits with an emoji, use [this](https://gitmoji.dev) as a guide
- Add opt-in languages flag where it returns the commit in different languages
- Add automated github releases using [this action](https://github.com/manovotny/github-releases-for-automated-package-publishing-action)
- Build landing page for the 2.0 launch
