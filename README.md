## Setup

> The minimum supported version of Node.js is the latest v14. Check your Node.js version with `node --version`.


1. Install _aicommits_:

    ```sh
    npm install -g aicommits
    ```

2. Retrieve your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

    > Note: If you haven't already, you'll have to create an account and set up billing.

3. Set the key so aicommits can use it:

    ```sh
    aicommits config set OPENAI_KEY=<your token>
    ```

    This will create a `.aicommits` file in your home directory.


### Upgrading

Check the installed version with:
```
aicommits --version
```

If it's not the [latest version](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits/releases/latest), run:

```sh
npm update -g aicommits
```

## Usage
### CLI mode

You can call `aicommits` directly to generate a commit message for your staged changes:

```sh
git add <files...>
aicommits
```

`aicommits` passes down unknown flags to `git commit`, so you can pass in [`commit` flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) (with some exceptions (e.g. `--all`):

```sh
aicommits --dry-run
```

### Configuration Options

This CLI tool provides the option to configure some of its settings using the `aicommits config` command. The available configuration options are:

-   `OPENAI_KEY`: This option allows you to set the API key for api.openai.com, which is required to access the OpenAI GPT-3 API. You can also set it using an environment variable named OPENAI_KEY, them there's no need to set it using the `aicommits config` command.

-   `generate`: This option determines the amount of commit messages that should be generated by the tool. The more commit messages generated, the higher the cost, as it requires more API calls to the OpenAI GPT-3 API. This can also by done with the cli option `-g`. The default value is 1.

-   `proxy`: This option allows you to set a http/https proxy to use for requests. If you want to clear the proxy option, you can use the command aicommits config set proxy= (note the empty value after the equals sign).

To set a configuration option, use the command `aicommits config set <key=value...>`. For example, to set the API key, you can use `aicommits config set OPENAI_KEY=<your-api-key>`. You can also set multiple configuration options at once by separating them with spaces, like `aicommits config set OPENAI_KEY=<your-api-key> generate=10 proxy=http://your-proxy-url`.

To retrieve a configuration option, use the command `aicommits config get <key...>`. For example, to retrieve the API key, you can use `aicommits config get OPENAI_KEY`. You can also retrieve multiple configuration options at once by separating them with spaces, like `aicommits config get OPENAI_KEY generate`.

Please note that setting any configuration option is optional and the CLI tool will still work without them.

### Git hook

You can also integrate _aicommits_ with Git via the [`prepare-commit-msg`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook. This lets you use Git like you normally would, and edit the commit message before committing.

#### Install

In the Git repository you want to install the hook in:
```sh
aicommits hook install
```

#### Uninstall
In the Git repository you want to uninstall the hook from:

```sh
aicommits hook uninstall
```

#### Usage

1. Stage your files and commit:
    ```sh
    git add <files...>
    git commit # Only generates a message when it's not passed in
    ```

    > If you ever want to write your own message instead of generating one, you can simply pass one in: `git commit -m "My message"`

2. Aicommits will generate the commit message for you and pass it back to Git. Git will open it with the [configured editor](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git) for you to review/edit it.

3. Save and close the editor to commit!


## How it works

This CLI tool runs `git diff` to grab all your latest code changes, sends them to OpenAI's GPT-3, then returns the AI generated commit message.

Video coming soon where I rebuild it from scratch to show you how to easily build your own CLI tools powered by AI.

## Future tasks

- Add support for conventional commits as a flag that users can enable
- Migrate to chatGPT instead of GPT-3
- Add support for diffs greater than 200 lines by grabbing the diff per file, optional flag
- Add ability to specify a commit message from inside aicommit if user doesn't like generated one
- Play around with prompt to produce optimal result
- Add an alias called `aic` that does "git add . && aicommits && git push"
- Add opt-in emoji flag to preface commits with an emoji, use [this](https://gitmoji.dev) as a guide
- Add opt-in languages flag where it returns the commit in different languages
- Build landing page for the 2.0 launch
